# Welcome to my project!

This is a simple python script made with Selenium to migrate your Spotify liked albums/playlists to a single playlist on Youtube Music, it's a kinda long process (5-10min)

First step: you need to install the requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Second step: After installing the requirements, go to your console and go into the project's folder `cd spotify_to_yt-main`
Inside the project's folder, type in the console `ytmusicapi oauth`, do the indicated process and that's it.

Third step: You will need the chromedriver executable, so, do what the video says: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNbcRZmJ-Ag,
copy the chromedriver executable into the project's folder and that's it.
